This App was developed by using MVVM Architecture.

In this app Following components were used :
Room,
Lifecycle,
ViewModel,
LiveData,
Data Binding

In this app, there are four activities:
Activity for Splash Screen,
Activity for Inserting notes,
Activity for updating notes, &
main Activity.
Recycler View is used for displaying the notes.

After Making this app I learned about MVVM Architecture & its components,
and I also learned about integration of Recycler View & Making the Recycler View Adapter
